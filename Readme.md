I am thrilled to do this unique assignment, I have been doing several task since I am looking for a good opportunity, but MoonDevs' unique assignment got through me.
I have picked the 2nd assignment because I don't understand the code functionality like what it is actually doing beacuse I am not familiar with blockchain conecpt and when I looked into the code I was getting confused but I do learn something new while searching and trying to understand the code. This was the time I thought to switch to the 2nd assignment that is "Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable" and when I started doing it, it was preety easy to understand and work with it. So I decided choose it. I hope the hiring team see my efforts and I hope for a place in MoonDevs's amazing team. THANK YOU.
